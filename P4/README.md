This repository contains programs made for project 4 produced in a collaboration between [Lasse](https://github.com/lasselb87), [Nicolai](https://github.com/nicolossus), and [Kristian](https://github.com/KristianWold).


### Contents

The [Classes](https://github.com/KristianWold/Compphys/tree/master/P4/classes) folder contains object-oriented code
for calculating Ising Model estimations using the Metropolis Algorithm, with some accompaying unit tests.

The [Results](https://github.com/KristianWold/Compphys/tree/master/P4/classes) folder contains all the results produced in this project.

**Solved Problems**

To compile the c++ implementation of the Metropolis Algorithm, run `make simulation.x`.
